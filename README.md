# FoodToYou
My project’s name is “Food to you” which is an online food delivery website. It is a full stack project covering both backend and frontend. 
The motivation behind this project was there are many hostel messes in Haldia where food orders are taken and delivered by phone calls, which is quite hectic for those mess owners. So, my team designed this website where we can add the mess or restaurant on the website from which people can order food online.
The functionalities provided in this project are broadly of 3 types
•	Login functionalities: This handles the login and registration of both the admin and user.
•	Admin functionalities: Admin here refers to the owner of the website, who can add, modify or remove a restaurant, food item and food category from the website.
•	User functionalities: User here refers to the customer, who can check the menu of different restaurants, add food items in his cart and place an order.
